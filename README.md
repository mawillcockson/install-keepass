# Installing [KeePass][]

This repository walks through installing [KeePass][] on Windows in a particular way.

It downloads [KeePass][] using [Python][] and [scoop][], and sets a [Scheduled Task][tasksch] to check for updates daily.

Follow this document to get started.

## Getting Started

To begin with, this will only work on recent versions of Windows. Running through the first step will tell us if your version of Windows is recent enough.

We'll install [Python][] first, as that is what this requires. The easiest way to do that would be to open a [PowerShell][] terminal by opening the Start Menu and typing PowerShell. This should look something like this:



[keepass]: <
[python]: <
[scoop]: <
[tasksch]: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/about-the-task-scheduler>
[powershell]: <
